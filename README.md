## The Impact of Technology on Human Connection


So first git clone "copied link" then make whatever changes and add files. <br>
Then git status can be done whenever to check. <br>
Then git add . , . is for all files or you can name the file instead <br>
Finally git commit -m "Whatever message you wanna give". <br>
Now git push origin "branch name". <br>

If you're making a repo in VSCode first, then create and modify a folder and git init  <br>
As usual add, commit. <br>
Then make a repo with the same name on github and copy link and git remote add origin "link" <br>
Now git remote -v to see that it's done <br>
Now git push origin main  <br>
Do git push -u origin main, to make origin main the default destination when you push  <br>
Use git branch to know what branches are there. <br>
git checkout is used to switch between branches <br>
To create a new branch, git checkout -b "name of branch"  <br>
git checkout "branch name" to switch branches <br>
git diff "branch name" to see what's different in that branch compared to the current branch <br>
git merge "branch name" to merge that with the current branch  <br>
Instead of merging, you can push the branch, go to github and create a pull request and later merge the pull request. <br>
git pull origin main, for getting the updates made on github locally. <br>



Branch name is usually "main".
In the rapidly evolving landscape of the **21st century**, technology has become an *integral part* of our daily lives, profoundly influencing how we communicate and connect with one another. 
> While technological advancements have undeniably brought about convenience and efficiency, they have also sparked a discourse on the impact of these tools on human relationships.

`The advent of social media platforms, for instance, has redefined the way we build and maintain connections.`
On one hand, it has facilitated global communication, allowing individuals to connect with others regardless of geographical boundaries. 
On the other hand, concerns have emerged about the ~~superficial nature of online interactions, where genuine human connections may be compromised~~ by curated online personas and the prevalence of virtual communication over face-to-face encounters. 😂 🎂 use : for emojis. `Check out basics of markdown`

Moreover, the pervasive use of smartphones and digital devices has altered the dynamics of personal interactions. 
In social settings, individuals often find themselves engrossed in screens rather than engaging in meaningful conversations. 
The challenge lies in striking a balance between the benefits of technological connectivity and the essential human need for authentic, in-person connections.

In conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we connect with one another, 
`it is essential to reflect on its implications for the quality of our relationships. `
Striving for a harmonious integration of technology into our lives that enhances rather than detracts from genuine human connection is a key challenge of our modern era.
