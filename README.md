## The Impact of Technology on Human Connection


So first git clone "copied link" then make whatever changes and add files. /n
Then git status can be done whenever to check. /n
Then git add . , . is for all files or you can name the file instead /n
Finally git commit -m "Whatever message you wanna give". /n
Now git push origin "branch name". /n

If you're making a repo in VSCode first, then create and modify a folder and git init  /n
As usual add, commit. /n
Then make a repo with the same name on github and copy link and git remote add origin "link" /n
Now git remote -v to see that it's done /n
Now git push origin main  /n
Do git push -u origin main, to make origin main the default destination when you push  /n
Use git branch to know what branches are there. /n
git checkout is used to switch between branches /n
To create a new branch, git checkout -b "name of branch"  /n
git checkout "branch name" to switch branches /n
git diff "branch name" to see what's different in that branch compared to the current branch /n
git merge "branch name" to merge that with the current branch  /n
Instead of merging, you can push the branch, go to github and create a pull request and later merge the pull request. /n

Moreover, the pervasive use of smartphones and digital devices has altered the dynamics of personal interactions.

In conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we connect with one another, 
`it is essential to reflect on its implications for the quality of our relationships. `
Striving for a harmonious integration of technology into our lives that enhances rather than detracts from genuine human connection is a key challenge of our modern era.
